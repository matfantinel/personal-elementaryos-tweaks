# Personal elementary tweaks
My set of scripts for tweaking elementary OS.


## elementary_tweaks
This script:

* Enables PPAs
* Installs `system76-power` to provide better power management
* Installs elementary-tweaks
* Enables app indicators


## dev_environment

Note: run `pre_dev_environment` first because NVM requires the terminal to be reset. I have to improve this sometime.

This script:

* Installs and sets up git (for me, if you're using please change the name/email on the script)
* Installs NodeJS via NVM
* Installs snapd
* Installs the snap version of .NET Core SDK 2.2
* Installs MongoDB
* Installs Angular CLI
